95. FRET-Based Assay: The HCV NS3 protease functions have been extensively studied and are considered as potential targets for antiviral therapy: see for example the many references listed in the introductory section of this application. Therefore, the activity of the compounds of the invention as anti-HCV agents was assessed using a full length HCV NS3 protease.The protease activity of the full length NS3/4a was measured using a FRET-based assay utilizing a peptide substrate derived from the NS4A/B cleavage site (Anaspec) and labelled at one end with a quencher (QXL520) and at the other with a fluorophore (5-FAMsp). NS3/4a (produced in-house by literature methods) was incubated with test compounds and peptide substrate in 50 mM Tris pH8, 20 mM DTT, 1% CHAPS, 10% glycerol and 5% DMSO. The reaction was followed by monitoring the change in fluorescence on a Molecular Devices Gemini plate reader for 30 minutes at room temperature.

1260. Inhibition Assay: The inhibition of full-length hepatitis C NS3 protease enzyme was measured essentially as described in Poliakov, 2002 Prot Expression & Purification 25 363 371. Briefly, the hydrolysis of a depsipeptide substrate, Ac-DED(Edans)EEAbu[COO]ASK(Dabcyl)-NH2 (AnaSpec, San Jose, USA), was measured spectrofluorometrically in the presence of a peptide cofactor, KKGSVVIVGRIVLSGK (Ake Engstrom, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Sweden). [Landro, 1997 #Biochem 36 9340-9348]. The enzyme (1 nM) was incubated in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM DTT, 40% glycerol, 0.1% n-octyl-D-glucoside, with 25  inverted question markM NS4A cofactor and inhibitor at 30 C. for 10 min, whereupon the reaction was initiated by addition of 0.5  inverted question markM substrate. Inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO, sonicated for 30 sec. and vortexed.

1636. Protease Assay: The HCV protease assay herein was applied to investigate the HCV-protease inhibitory activity of the prepared compounds as described above. The method of the HCV protease assay was described in D. T. Phuong, C. M. Ma, M. Hattori and J. S. J in: Inhibitory Effects of Antrodins A-E from Antrodia cinnamomea and Their Metabolites on Hepatitis C Virus Protease. Phytotherapy Research, 23, 582-584, 2009. Two micro liters of a compound solution (using DMSO as solvent) was placed in 384 well micro plate, then 8 ul of HCV NS3/4A protease (0.5 g/mL) was added to the well containing a sample and the plate was agitated. Finally, 10 uL of freshly prepared substrate (Ac-Asp-Glu-Dap(QXL 520)-Glu-Glu-Abu-COO-Ala-Ser-Cys(5-FAMsp)-NH2) (100 dilution of a DMSO stock solution) was added with sequential rotational shaking. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 C. The fluorimetric analyses were performed on an automated TECAN GENios plate reader with excitation wavelength at 485

3143. Enzyme Assay: An on-bead solid phase homogeneous assay was used in a 384-well format to assess NS5B inhibitors (WangY-K, Rigat K, Roberts S, and Gao M (2006) Anal Biochem, 359: 106-111). The biotinylated oligo dT12 primer was captured on streptavidin-coupled imaging beads (GE, RPNQ0261) by mixing primer and beads in 1X buffer and incubating at room temperature for three hours. Unbound primer was removed after centrifugation. The primer-bound beads were resuspended in 3X reaction mix (20 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, dT primer coupled beads, poly A template, 3H-UTP, and RNAse inhibitor (Promega N2515)). Compounds were serially diluted 1:3 in DMSO and aliquoted into assay plates. Equal volumes (10 uL) of water, 3X reaction mix, and enzyme in 3X assay buffer (60 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 7.5 mM KCl, 3 mM DTT, 0.03 mg/mL BSA, 6% glycerol) were added to the diluted compound on the assay plate. Final concentration of components in 384-well assay: 0.36 nM template, 15 nM primer.

3144. Radiolabeled Nucleotide Incorporation Assay: To measure inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by the nucleoside triphosphate compounds of the present invention, a radiolabeled nucleotide incorporation assay was used. This assay is a modified version of the assay described in International Publication No. WO2002/057287. Briefly, 50 uL reactions containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3); 7.5 mM DTT; 20 units/ml RNasIN; 1 uM each of ATP, GTP, UTP and CTP; 20 uCi/mL [33P]-CTP; 10 mM MgCl; 60 mM NaCl; 100 ug/ml BSA; 0.021 uM DCoH heteropolymer RNA template; and 5 nM NS5B (1b-BKDelta55) enzyme are incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The assay is then terminated by the addition of 500 mM EDTA (50 uL). The reaction mixture is transferred to a Millipore DE81 filter plate and the incorporation of labeled CTP is determined using Packard TopCount. Compound IC50 values can then be calculated from experiments with 10 serial 3-fold dilutions of the inhibitor in

Chem. 2006, 3793-3799) mutant polymerase enzyme was used in this assay. NS5b polymerase assay (40 uL) was assembled by adding 28 uL polymerase mixture (final concentration: 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM EDTA, 4 ng/uL of RNA template, and 75 nM HCV D21 NS5b polymerase) to assay plates followed by 4 uL of compound dilution. The polymerase and compound were pre-incubated at 35 C. for 10 minute before the addition of 8 uL of nucleotide substrate mixture (33P-gamma-labeled competing nucleotide at KM and 0.5 mM of the remaining three nucleotides). The assay plates were covered and incubated at 35 C. for 90 min. Reactions were then filtered through 96-well DEAE-81 filter plates via vacuum. The filter plates were then washed under vacuum with multiple volumes of 0.125 M NaHPO4, water, and ethanol.

3265. Inhibition Assay: To measure inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by the nucleoside triphosphate compounds of the present invention, a radiolabeled nucleotide incorporation assay was used. This assay is a modified version of the assay described in International Publication No. WO2002/057287. Briefly, 50 uL reactions containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3); 7.5 mM DTT; 20 units/ml RNasIN; 1 uM each of ATP, GTP, UTP and CTP; 20 uCi/mL [33P]-CTP; 10 mM MgCl; 60 mM NaCl; 100 ug/ml BSA; 0.021 uM DCoH heteropolymer RNA template; and 5 nM NS5B (1b-BK inverted question mark55) enzyme were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The assay was then terminated by the addition of 500 mM EDTA (50 uL). The reaction mixture was transferred to a Millipore DE81 filter plate and the incorporation of labeled CTP is determined using Packard TopCount. Compound IC50 values can then be calculated from experiments with 10 serial 3-fold dilutions of the inhibitor in dupli

3266. Inhibition Assay: The inhibitory effects of the compounds of the invention on HCV replication can be determined by measuring activity of the luciferase reporter gene. For example, replicon-containing cells can be seeded into 96 well plates at a density of 5000 cells per well in 100 A inverted question markl DMEM containing 5% FBS. The following day compounds can be diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to generate a 200A? stock in a series of eight half-log dilutions. The dilution series can then be further diluted 100-fold in the medium containing 5% FBS. Medium with the inhibitor is added to the overnight cell culture plates already containing 100 A inverted question markl of DMEM with 5% FBS. In assays measuring inhibitory activity in the presence of human plasma, the medium from the overnight cell culture plates can be replaced with DMEM containing 40% human plasma and 5% FBS.
