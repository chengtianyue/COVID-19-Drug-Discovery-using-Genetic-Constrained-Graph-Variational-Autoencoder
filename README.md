# Covid-19 Drug Discovery Using Constrained Graph Variational Autoencoder and Genetic Algorithm

## Outline

1, Using constrained graph variational autoencoder to generate molecules. Classify each molecules using edge memory neural network

2, Docking the molecules with the Covid-19 protease using autodock vina

3, Finding several novel molecules that could be served as potential treatments

4, Applying GA to select most diverse molecules(Avoid similar molecules generated in step 3)

5, Calculate the Docking Score


## Updating Timeline

2020.8.10: Updated GA

2020.8.12: Revised the Structure of the repo.
