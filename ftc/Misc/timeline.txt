Timeline for this project

Visualize structure of 2019-nCov with N3 inhibitor.
	-Visualize hydrogen bonds

Separate structure from inhibitor.
	-Re-dock into protein using Vina.
	-Identify residues involved in binding or potentially involved in binding 		-Re-dock with high exhaustiveness and flexibility if possible.
	-Establish a baseline score	

Build dataset of protease inhibitors (aim for 2500 compounds)
	-SARS
	-MERS
	-HIV
	-Hepatitis
	-others? west nile? dengue?

De-Novo design using the dataset
	-GENTRL
	-One other?

Dock potential candidates with Vina

Dock potential candidates with a deep learning method

Make final notebook
	-Look at structures/similarities
	-Generating molecules
